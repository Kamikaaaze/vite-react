  <h1>The Kite Runner</h1>
  <p>Author : Khaled Hosseini</p>
  <p>Summary</p>
  <p>Absolute URLs in your source code will be resolved using the project root as base, so you can write code as if you are working with a normal static file server (except way more powerful!). Vite is also capable of handling dependencies that resolve to out-of-root file system locations, which makes it usable even in a monorepo-based setup.</p>
